# Next Generation

Next Generation is largely based on another simple Rails app I created to help educators share resources with and invite online interations between learners.

Concerning design and development, the app attempts to apply:

* mobile-first development through Bootstrap

* minimal data usage for page loads

* strong privacy standards

* flexibility to include all learning mediums

This app will be used for a specific pre-service teacher training program in Chernivtsi, Ukraine.
