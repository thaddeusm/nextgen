# Read Feed

Read Feed was created as a simple way for educators to deliver learning content and facilitate interactions between learners.  Concerning design and development, the app attempts to apply:

* mobile-first development through Bootstrap

* minimal data usage for page loads

* strong privacy standards

* flexibility to include all learning mediums

This version is considered 'beta', being used by one pilot institution in hopes of creating a global version in the future.
